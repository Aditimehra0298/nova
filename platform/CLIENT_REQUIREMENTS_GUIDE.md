## 💡 How Match Score Works

The match score (0-100%) is calculated based on:
1. **Real View Counts** - Higher views = Higher score
2. **Industry Match** - If you filter by industry, matching influencers get higher score
3. **Location Match** - If you filter by location, matching influencers get higher score

**Best Practice**: Leave filters empty to see top performers, then use filters to narrow down.
